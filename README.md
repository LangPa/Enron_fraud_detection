# Analysing the Enron Dataset for fraudulant activity

This is my final project for Udacity's Introduction to Machine Learning course. Whilst all the code was written by myself, the data was sourced from Udacity and can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects.git)

The full write-up for the project may be viewed in the (poi_id.ipynb)[https://github.com/LangPa/Enron_fraud_detection/blob/master/poi_id.ipynb] file
